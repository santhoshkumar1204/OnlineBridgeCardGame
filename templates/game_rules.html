            <h2>GAME RULES</h2> 
    
            <p><strong>What is Bridge?</strong></p>
            <p>Bridge is a classic trick-taking card game played by four players in two teams (called partnerships). Players bid on how many tricks they expect to win and then play to fulfill their contract.</p>
    
            <p><strong>Key Terms:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Partnership</strong> – A team of two players.</p>
            <p><strong>Trick</strong> – A round where each player plays one card.</p>
            <p><strong>Bid</strong> – A prediction of the number of tricks (1–7) the team expects to win, along with a suit or No Trump.</p>
            <p><strong>Pass</strong> – Choosing not to make a bid.</p>
            <p><strong>Contract</strong> – The final winning bid that sets the goal for the round.</p>
            <p><strong>Trump / No Trump</strong> – The chosen suit that outranks all others, or "No Trump" meaning no suit has priority.</p>
            <p><strong>Declarer</strong> – The player who wins the bidding and leads the gameplay.</p>
            <p><strong>Dummy</strong> – The declarer’s partner; their cards are laid face-up after the bidding.</p>
            <p><strong>Lead</strong> – The first card played in a trick.</p>
    
            <p><strong>How to Play Bridge: Step by Step</strong></p>
    
            <p><strong>Before You Start</strong></p>
            <p>Bridge uses a standard 52-card deck.</p>
            <p>Each player receives 13 cards.</p>
            <p>Players organize their cards by suit.</p>
            <p>A new dealer is chosen each round.</p>
    
            <p><strong>Step 1: Bidding</strong></p>
            <p>Each player takes turns bidding a number (1–7) and a suit or No Trump.</p>
            <p>Each bid must be higher than the previous, or the player can choose to pass.</p>
            <p>The highest bid becomes the contract, setting the number of tricks that partnership must win.</p>
    
            <p><strong>Step 2: Gameplay</strong></p>
            <p>The declarer leads the first trick.</p>
            <p>The dummy reveals their hand face-up.</p>
            <p>All players must follow suit if possible.</p>
            <p>The highest card wins the trick, unless a trump is played.</p>
    
            <p><strong>Step 3: Winning a Trick</strong></p>
            <p>If a trump card is played, the highest trump wins.</p>
            <p>If no trumps are played, the highest card of the led suit wins.</p>
            <p>A total of 13 tricks are played per round.</p>
            <p>At the end, teams count the number of tricks won to determine success.</p>
    
            <p><strong>Strategic Tips for Success</strong></p>
            <p>Support your partner’s bids for better coordination.</p>
            <p>Pass if your hand totals fewer than 13 points.</p>
            <p>Bid 1 No Trump if you have 16–18 balanced points.</p>
            <p>With 13+ points, start by bidding your strongest suit.</p>
            <p>Observe and adapt based on your opponents' play.</p>
