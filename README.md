# Online Bridge Card Game

This is a software project developed as part of the Advanced Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis course at SSN College of Engineering. It replicates the traditional 4-player Bridge card game in a web-based format using Python and Flask.

## About the Project

The Online Bridge Card Game simulates a full game session involving card distribution, bidding, 13 trick rounds, and winner evaluation. The system generates and manages 28,561 possible 4-card combinations using efficient data structures. The game applies official Bridge rules, including suit-following, trick-taking, and turn rotation, ensuring fairness and strategy in play.

The project integrates front-end and back-end components, featuring user registration, room creation, bidding history, and real-time game play. Data is managed using arrays, heaps, red-black trees, queues, and maps to handle complexity and optimize performance.

## Technologies Used

- *Frontend:* HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- *Backend:* Python, Flask
- *Data Storage:* CSV files
- *Data Structures:* Heap, Red-Black Tree, Queue, Map

## How to Run

1. *Clone the repository* or download the ZIP.
2. Make sure *Python* and *Flask* are installed.
3. Open terminal in the project folder.
4. Run the Flask app using:

   ```bash
   python app.py

  Note: This project runs locally and simulates multiplayer logic. Internet based multiplayer support is not included in this version
